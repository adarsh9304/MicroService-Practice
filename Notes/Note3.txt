The Saga pattern consists of a series of local transactions with compensating transactions to roll back in case of failures. It would be helpful to describe this in more depth:
Each service completes a local transaction and publishes an event for the next service to continue the workflow.
If a failure occurs, the Saga triggers compensating transactions to undo the previous steps.
It would be better if you highlighted the two types of Sagas: choreography (event-driven) and orchestration (centralized control).


Handling Failures:

Your response to failure scenarios is a bit too brief. You mentioned "revert whole process," but this could be elaborated. In a Saga pattern, failure handling is done by triggering compensating transactions. You need to clearly state how you would:
Detect the failure.
Trigger a compensating transaction to reverse actions already completed.
You should also explain that the Saga pattern is eventual consistency. Services are not immediately consistent but reach consistency over time, which is a trade-off for scalability and availability.


You chose the Saga pattern, which is a good option for microservices. However, you should mention why you wouldnâ€™t use two-phase commit (2PC). For example:
2PC is not ideal for distributed systems because it locks resources across services, leading to potential performance bottlenecks.
Sagas are more suitable for microservices because they are non-blocking, scalable, and more resilient to failure.
You could also mention that eventual consistency is often preferred in microservices over strong consistency, especially for long-running transactions.


You could have discussed how to ensure idempotency in Saga compensating actions to avoid problems caused by repeated transactions.
You should mention distributed tracing for monitoring transactions across services, which is essential to track the flow of events in a Saga.
